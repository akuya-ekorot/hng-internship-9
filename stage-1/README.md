# Stage 1: HNG Internship 9

This folder contains the source code for my Stage 1 task in the [HNG Internship 9.](https://internship.zuri.team/hngi9)
<br />
<br />

## Task Brief

We were asked to make a page like linktree that has profile information about a person and has links leading to various places in the internet. Like external links or digital products.

The design was provided in Figma with pre-defined styles and elements.

Our job was to bring the design to life using React and deploy the page.

## What I loved about this task

- I loved the challenge of having to figure out the width of the device in use and using that information to conditionally render the share button.

- I got to build the tooltip on the share button from scratch and control it's visibitlity based on a peer's hover state.

- I also loved implimenting slight changes to an element's appearance based on different states like hover, focus, and disabled.

- Tailwindcss really made my development experience better and faster as it helped me implemet a lot of css with comparatively fewer lines.

## Challenges I faced.
- I've noticed I don't have a strong foundational knowledge on React Hooks. I now intend to do a deep dive and make sure I understand these concepts better.

- I'm transitioning to us typescript more and more. I sometimes got stuck in the huge project figuring out types but with experience this will become better.
